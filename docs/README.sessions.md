# workspace sessions

Show which panes in a workspace are running a coding agent, whether each is working or idle, and any sub-agents they have started.

## Usage

```sh
workspace sessions [options] [project]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | Emit the raw payload instead of a table |
| `--watch` | Redraw until interrupted |
| `--interval SECONDS` | Seconds between redraws when watching (default 2) |

## Details

Requires a running agent daemon for the project (`workspace agent <project>`, or launched automatically by [`workspace launch`](README.launch.md)). If no daemon is listening, the command fails with a message telling you how to start one. `workspace doctor` also reports whether the daemon is running for the current project.

`project` defaults to the project detected from the current directory, same as other commands.

The daemon holds the session state; this command only asks for it, over the agent's Unix socket. That keeps `--json` and the table behind one code path, so scripting against `--json` sees exactly what the table shows.

Each pane shows its index, kind, title, state (`working`/`idle`), and how long it's been idle. Sub-agents started within a pane (Claude Code's `Task` tool invocations) are listed indented underneath their parent pane.

## Examples

```sh
# Show sessions for the current directory's project
workspace sessions

# Show sessions for a named project
workspace sessions my-project

# Watch and redraw every 2 seconds
workspace sessions --watch

# Watch with a custom interval
workspace sessions --watch --interval 5

# Emit raw JSON for scripting
workspace sessions --json
```
